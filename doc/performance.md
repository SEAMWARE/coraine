# Performance and footprint

Every number on this page was measured on one machine on 2026-09-16, from
release builds of the commit it ships with, and each section says how. Nothing
here is a vendor estimate or a figure carried over from an earlier version. The
summary table is in the [README](https://github.com/SEAMWARE/coraine#footprint-and-speed);
this is the working underneath it.


## Where these numbers come from

One machine, and a laptop one:

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX — 16 physical cores / 32 threads, 64 MiB L3, 5.39 GHz boost |
| RAM | 60 GiB |
| OS | Ubuntu 26.04, gcc 15.2.0, x86-64 |
| Build | `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (`-O2`), stripped, `COR_FEATURE_ICU_COLLATION=OFF` |
| Beside it | MongoDB 4.4 (container, replica set) · PostgreSQL 18 + TimescaleDB 2.25 (host) |

Four builds are measured throughout — the two axes that change what a coraine
process is made of:

- **HTTP server** — `COR_HTTP_SERVER=builtin`, the epoll server in `corHttp`,
  with no external dependency at all; or `COR_HTTP_SERVER=mhd`, the external
  libmicrohttpd.
- **Current-state DB** — `--database corDB`, entities in this process's own RAM;
  or `--database mongoc`, entities in a MongoDB server.

TRoE is `none` unless a row says otherwise, and the `admin` API plugin (23 KiB)
is not loaded.

### Every rate here is per core

A throughput figure with no core count beside it says more about the machine
than about the broker, so the broker is pinned to a stated number of **physical**
cores and the load generator runs on cores the broker was never given. Dividing
a whole-machine total by the core count would be a different measurement — it
assumes the scaling it would be claiming to show.

SMT is the trap, and not a hypothetical: an early run put the load generator on
the **siblings** of the broker's own cores, so the two fought over the same
silicon and the scaling curve turned *down* at the top, which reads exactly like
a broker that fails to scale. The CPU list is read from
`/sys/devices/system/cpu` — one logical CPU per physical core — never assumed.

Each figure is the median of three 5-second `wrk -t8 -c50` runs, and each whole
run waits for the machine to go quiet (load average below 2) before it starts.
Without that wait, a run measured in the wake of the previous one's load
generator came out up to 13% low. Every scenario was measured twice, in
independent passes; the spread between passes was 0.8–7.5%.

The fixture is 100 five-attribute entities of ~550 bytes each, so a `limit=20`
query returns about 11 KB — a realistic page rather than a toy.

A rate measured over error responses is not a rate, so every `wrk` run is
checked for non-2xx answers and the run stops if it finds any. That guard exists
because a create scenario once reported 166 036 creates/s — faster than a
PATCH, impossible — which turned out to be the speed of answering 409 to
duplicate ids.

## Size on disk — what installing coraine adds

Stripped, and counting only what a machine does not already have. The reference
is a bare `ubuntu:26.04`: nine to eleven of the libraries coraine maps — libc,
libm, libstdc++, libgcc_s, libssl, libcrypto, libz, libzstd, libgmp, libresolv,
the dynamic loader, ~14.5 MiB of them — are already in that image for reasons
that have nothing to do with a context broker. They are **mentioned, not
counted**: coraine does not install them and removing coraine does not remove
them.

| Configuration | coraine's own code | Added libraries | **Total added** |
|---------------|-------------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| `corHttp` + `corDB` | 1.00 MiB | 3.27 MiB (3) | **4.28 MiB** |
| `corHttp` + `mongoc` | 1.08 MiB | 10.04 MiB (6) | **11.12 MiB** |
| libmicrohttpd + `corDB` | 0.99 MiB | 10.56 MiB (12) | **11.55 MiB** |
| libmicrohttpd + `mongoc` | 1.07 MiB | 17.33 MiB (15) | **18.40 MiB** |

**A complete NGSI-LD broker, in-memory store included, is 4.3 MiB of things that
were not on the machine before — and three of those libraries are not ours.**

Those four rows all have TRoE off. Turning history on is the same measure, and
it is the clearest single number on this page:

| Configuration | coraine's own code | Added libraries | **Total added** |
|---------------|-------------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| `corHttp` + `corDB` + **history in-process** | 1.02 MiB | 3.27 MiB (3) | **4.29 MiB** |
| `corHttp` + `corDB` + history in PostgreSQL | 1.08 MiB | 5.57 MiB (13) | 6.65 MiB |
| libmicrohttpd + `mongoc` + history in PostgreSQL | 1.12 MiB | 19.53 MiB (24) | **20.66 MiB** |

`ramdb` — temporal history in this process — adds **no library and no
measurable size**. The full conventional deployment is 24 libraries against 3,
and 20.7 MiB against 4.3.

What the three columns are made of:

- **coraine's own code is all of it.** The cor and k libraries are static
  archives, whole-archived into the binary, so that 963 KiB is not a `main`
  calling out to something else — it *is* `corNgsild` (341 KiB of NGSI-LD rules),
  the broker's own service routines (361 KiB), `corRest` (50 KiB), `kargs`
  (45 KiB), `corJsonld` (31 KiB), `kjson` (31 KiB), `corHttp` (12 KiB), and
  `kprom`/`kalloc`/`ktrace`/`kbase`/`corPlugin`/`khash` under 6 KiB each. Every
  line of it is in this project's repositories. Add the DB plugin (`corDB.so`
  39 KiB or `mongoc.so` 116 KiB) and `none.so` (14 KiB) and that is the whole
  broker.
- **The three added libraries in the first row** are GEOS (`libgeos` +
  `libgeos_c`, 3.17 MiB — geo-queries) and `libmosquitto` (106 KiB — MQTT
  notifications). GEOS is now the largest single thing coraine puts on a machine,
  and it is larger than coraine.
- **libmicrohttpd costs nine libraries, 7.29 MiB** — not its own 608 KiB, because
  it pulls GnuTLS behind it, and p11-kit, nettle, hogweed, tasn1, idn2,
  libunistring, libffi. Building the HTTP server in removes all nine for 12 KiB
  of `corHttp`. That is the 3-vs-12 in the table.
- **`mongoc` costs three libraries, 6.77 MiB** — `libmongoc`, `libbson`,
  `libsasl2` — before MongoDB itself is installed anywhere.

> **ICU is off in every row above, deliberately.** § 7.6.2.1 names ICU "root"
> collation as the default order for `orderBy` on strings, and linking ICU for it
> costs **three libraries and 39.2 MiB** — `libicudata` alone is 31.6 MiB, nine
> times the whole broker, for a collation table. `COR_FEATURE_ICU_COLLATION=ON`
> buys it back; the ICU-free build sorts ASCII exactly as root collation does and
> approximates the rest. Replacing it with a collation implementation of our own
> — the common case first, tailorings added on demand — is on the roadmap.
## RAM

Resident set of the broker process. *Private dirty* is the part no other process
shares: what a second broker on the same machine actually costs.

| Configuration | Idle RSS | Private dirty | 100 000 entities | Per entity |
|---------------|---------:|--------------:|-----------------:|-----------:|
| libmicrohttpd + `corDB` | **13 MiB** | **3 MiB** | 358 MiB | 3.53 KiB |
| `corHttp` + `corDB` | 17 MiB | 9 MiB | 354 MiB | 3.45 KiB |
| libmicrohttpd + `mongoc` | 20 MiB | 4 MiB | 68 MiB *+ mongod* | — |
| `corHttp` + `mongoc` | 24 MiB | 10 MiB | **45 MiB** *+ mongod* | — |

The built-in server starts ~4 MiB heavier, and deliberately: it allocates its
connection pool at start-up, so no request ever calls `malloc` for its own
machinery. libmicrohttpd reserves far more than that, but virtually —
thread-per-connection stacks put its `VmSize` in the gigabytes, almost none of
it touched.

With **`corDB` an entity is RAM**, and that is the number to size a box with:
**~3.5 KiB resident per five-attribute entity**, so 100 000 entities is ~355 MiB
and a million is ~3.5 GiB. With `mongoc` the entities are MongoDB's problem and
the broker stays nearly flat — but then MongoDB is on the machine, which is the
next two sections.

> The `mongoc` figures here are lower than this page carried before (68 MiB
> against 202) and the difference is the **measurement**, not the broker. The
> entities used to be loaded one POST at a time; they are now loaded in batches
> of 200, so the broker handles 500 requests instead of 100 000 and carries far
> less request-arena footprint afterwards. Both are real numbers about real
> deployments — the label has to say which.

## What else has to be running

| `--database` / `--troe` | Also required | What that costs |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `corDB` / `none` | **nothing** | — |
| `corDB` / `ramdb` | **nothing** | temporal history in the same process, and it is free — see below |
| `mongoc` | a MongoDB server | 1.02–1.15 GiB resident at rest, and WiredTiger's cache defaults to half of (RAM − 1 GiB): on this 60 GiB host mongod is entitled to ~30 GiB. Plus **cores** — see below. Image: `mongo:4.4` 594 MB, `mongo:8` 1.3 GB |
| `timescale` (TRoE) | a PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB server | 35 MB of packages, 128 MiB of shared buffers by default, 313 MiB across its 10 processes here — and on the broker's own machine **2.3 MiB and 9–10 added libraries** for `libpq`, which drags in Kerberos, LDAP and SASL that a broker never calls. Nine rather than ten when `mongoc` has already brought `libsasl2` |

Which is the point of the first two rows. A `corHttp` + `corDB` + `ramdb`
deployment is **one process, 17 MiB, 4.3 MiB of new files on disk, and no socket
to anything else** — with temporal history included.

## Start-up

From `exec` to a served HTTP response:

| Configuration | Ready in |
|---------------|---------:|
| libmicrohttpd + `corDB` | **9 ms** |
| `corHttp` + `corDB` | 12 ms |
| libmicrohttpd + `mongoc` | 26 ms |
| `corHttp` + `mongoc` | 31 ms |

corHttp's extra 3 ms is the connection pool it allocates up front; mongoc's
extra 17 ms is the handshake with the database server. All four are fast enough
that the broker is not something you keep warm — it is something you start.
Scale-to-zero, per-test instances, one broker per tenant on a gateway: all of
them stop being awkward at 12 ms and 17 MiB.

## Throughput — per core

**One physical core.** `GET /ngsi-ld/v1/entities?type=Vehicle&limit=N`.

The page size is the whole story, and for months every throughput number
quoted anywhere was the `limit=20` one — read by everybody as requests per
second with the "of 20 entities" left off. Requests/s and entities/s are the
same number only at `limit=1`:

| Response | req/s per core | **entities/s per core** |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 entity | **37 743** | 37 743 |
| 20 entities | 6 588 | **131 760** |
| 100 entities | 1 583 | **158 300** |

*(libmicrohttpd + `corDB`. The per-request cost is fixed, so the bigger the
page the more of it is amortised — and the entities/s column is still climbing
at 100.)*

**All four builds, `limit=20`:**

| Configuration | req/s per core | entities/s per core |
|---------------|---------------:|--------------------:|
| libmicrohttpd + `corDB` | **6 588** | **131 760** |
| `corHttp` + `corDB` | 5 901 | 118 020 |
| libmicrohttpd + `mongoc` | 4 904 | 98 080 |
| `corHttp` + `mongoc` | 4 634 | 92 680 |

One core of a laptop CPU, going through MongoDB, still serves ~4 900 NGSI-LD
queries a second.

### Writes, and what batching is worth

Half of what a context broker does is writes, and until 2026-09-15 this page
had no write number on it at all. That was also the half that was broken:
`corDB` had no locking whatsoever, and twenty concurrent PATCHes killed the
broker every time. A read-only benchmark could never have noticed.

**Per core, `corDB`:**

| Operation | req/s | **entities/s** | vs one at a time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `PATCH` one attribute, 50 clients | 42 234 | 42 234 | — |
| `PATCH`, 1 client | 28 009 | 28 009 | — |
| batch update, 20 per request | 6 563 | **131 260** | **3.1×** |
| create one entity | 31 362 | 31 362 | — |
| batch create, 20 per request | 5 682 | **113 640** | **3.6×** |

Batching is worth three to four times per entity, which is what batching is
supposed to be for: one HTTP request, one URL-parameter parse, one `@context`
resolution and one lock acquisition amortised over twenty instead of paid
twenty times.

It was not always. Until the commit that added the create benchmark, batch
create walked the entire entity list for every incoming entity — with the id
index sitting right there, maintained by the bottom of the same loop — and was
**6× slower per entity than creating them one at a time**. A batch create is
the one operation that grows the store it is scanning, so it got worse as it
ran. Nothing measured it, so nothing caught it.

### Clients piling onto one core

Same core, same query, more clients:

| Clients | libmicrohttpd | p99 | `corHttp` | p99 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 | 6 239 | 3.43 ms | 5 359 | **1.79 ms** |
| 50 | 6 030 | 106.8 ms | 5 834 | **42.9 ms** |
| 200 | 6 147 | 206.0 ms | 4 821 | **75.8 ms** |
| 1000 | 5 654 | 292.0 ms | 4 790 | 303.0 ms |

Throughput is **flat across a hundredfold increase in clients** — 6 239 to
5 654, down 9%. The additional clients wait; they do not make the broker slower
at serving the ones already there. That is the property worth having, and it is
a different claim from a peak.

corHttp holds p99 two to three times lower up to 200 clients. Past that both
servers are queueing and the tail is the queue, not the server.

## What the database costs

Every figure above pins the *broker* to one core and lets the database have the
rest of the machine. That is the right way to measure a broker core, and it
quietly assumes a database that is never the limit. Here is the price of that
assumption.

**Cores of *deployment* behind one saturated broker core** — measured CPU of
both processes, not assumed:

| | `corDB` | `mongoc` |
|---|---:|---:|
| query, `limit=20` | **1.00** | 1.65 |
| `GET /entities/{id}` | **1.00** | 2.27 |
| `PATCH` | **1.00** | 3.61 |
| batch update | **1.00** | **5.06** |

**And the sweep that answers "how much does MongoDB need in order not to be the
bottleneck?"** — broker fixed at one core, mongod's core budget narrowed with
the container's cpuset:

| mongod cores | query | `PATCH` | batch-20 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 4 978 | 4 491 | 544 |
| 2 | 4 862 | 7 776 | 959 |
| 3 | 4 517 | **8 553** | 1 243 |
| 4 | 4 486 | 8 265 | **1 392** |
| 5 | 4 838 | 8 148 | 1 390 |
| 6 | 4 604 | 8 290 | 1 426 |
| 7 | 4 499 | 8 193 | 1 388 |

**Reads need one mongod core. Writes need three, and batch writes four.** Five
cores of machine to do what `corDB` does on one.

### One machine, eight cores, shared by everything

The tables above are per broker core. This one is the question somebody buying
a machine actually asks: eight cores, and whatever the configuration needs
running on them. The load generator is not in the budget — it stands in for
clients, which are somebody else's machines.

| Configuration | `limit=1` | `limit=20` | ent/s | `PATCH` | batch-20 | ent/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `corDB` | **152 448** | **40 073** | **801 460** | **125 187** | 17 239 | **344 780** |
| `corDB` + history in-process | 150 056 | 40 257 | 805 140 | 123 307 | 17 013 | 340 260 |
| `corDB` + history in PostgreSQL | 147 654 | 39 806 | 796 120 | 11 099 | 1 055 | 21 100 |
| `mongoc` | 60 527 | 23 185 | 463 700 | 19 961 | 1 994 | 39 880 |
| `mongoc` + history in PostgreSQL | 59 754 | 22 947 | 458 940 | 8 251 | 753 | 15 060 |

Three things fall out of that table.

**Temporal history in-process is free.** `--troe ramdb` against `--troe none`:
40 257 against 40 073 on queries, 123 307 against 125 187 on PATCH. Within the
noise, on every shape. History in PostgreSQL costs `corDB` **91% of its PATCH
rate and 94% of its batch rate** — not because PostgreSQL is slow, but because
`corDB`'s writes are otherwise nearly free, so the database becomes all of the
cost. On `mongoc`, where writes already cost something, TRoE takes a further
59%.

**Queries do not care.** Every configuration reads at the same speed with
history on or off, which is what you would hope: nothing on the read path
touches the history database.

**Scaling to eight cores is 6.1×**, not 8: 6 588 req/s on one core against
40 073 on eight. The missing 24% is the store's lock and the memory system,
and it is measured rather than extrapolated.

> ⚠️ The `limit=1` column may be partly **load-generator bound**. All three
> `corDB` rows land at 147–152k, and at that rate `wrk` on eight physical cores

## An open question: `--connectionPoolSize`

`corHttp` came out **slower than libmicrohttpd on one core** in the table above
(5 901 against 6 588), and it used to be the other way round. The loop count is
not the cause — `--httpLoops` resolves to 1 on one core, which is correct, and
forcing 2 or 4 there makes it worse, as it should.

The suspect is `--connectionPoolSize`, which defaults to 32. Swept on one core,
built-in server:

| `--connectionPoolSize` | req/s | p99 |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 6 469 | **9.97 ms** |
| 4 | 6 459 | 20.2 ms |
| 8 | **6 905** | 36.2 ms |
| 16 | 5 082 | 50.8 ms |
| 32 (default) | 5 562 | 44.0 ms |
| 64 | 5 850 | 38.8 ms |

There is something real in the low end — 2 and 8 both beat the default, and 2
holds a tail four times shorter — but **this is not yet a number to act on**,
because 16 measured worse than both 8 and 32 and a genuine trend does not do
that. Either the run-to-run spread is larger than the effect, or something
non-monotonic is going on.

And the option cannot simply be re-defaulted, because it means three different
things at once:

| | libmicrohttpd | `corHttp` |
|---|---|---|
| `corRestBackendStart(poolSize)` | libmicrohttpd's **I/O thread count** | connection **slots**, `poolSize × 16` |
| `corRestWorkerPoolStart(poolSize)` | request **worker threads** | request **worker threads** |

So lowering it to 8 cuts libmicrohttpd's I/O threads fourfold — measured at 15%
of its throughput — while for `corHttp` it lowers workers *and* connection
capacity together, so the sweep above cannot say which of the two the gain came
from. One knob, three concepts, and a default that was sized on a 16-core
laptop.

Separating them is the work: a worker count that is its own option, sized per
CPU the way `--httpLoops` is, and a connection capacity that stays a capacity.

## Reproducing this

- **Throughput, writes, page sizes** — [`test/perf/perfRun.sh`](https://github.com/SEAMWARE/coraine/blob/main/test/perf/perfRun.sh)
  measures the fixed request shapes and prints one JSON object per run. Set
  `PERF_BROKER_CORES=n` to pin the broker to *n* physical cores and the load
  generator off them; `PERF_ENTITIES` sizes the store; `PERF_BROKER_ARGS` and
  `PERF_BROKER_CMD` say what to start, so a documented number names its flags.
- **Core scaling** — [`test/perf/coreScale.sh`](https://github.com/SEAMWARE/coraine/blob/main/test/perf/coreScale.sh)
  reads the CPU topology rather than assuming it.
- **Size** — a stripped release build, plus the transitive `ldd` closure of the
  binary and the loaded plugins, minus everything a bare `ubuntu:26.04` already
  carries.
- **RAM** — `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`, idle and with the store loaded.
- **Start-up** — `exec` to a served HTTP response.
- **What the database costs** — `/proc/<pid>/stat` utime+stime for both
  processes across a fixed run, and `docker update --cpuset-cpus` to narrow
  mongod's core budget.

The two build axes are `-DCOR_HTTP_SERVER=builtin|mhd` and `--database
corDB|mongoc`; the reference build is ICU-free
(`-DCOR_FEATURE_ICU_COLLATION=OFF`, and `COR_WITH_ICU=0` for `corNgsild`).
[Building from source](building.md) has the rest of the switches.
